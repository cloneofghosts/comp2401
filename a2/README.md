Purpose: To compute a students final grade using a variety of different weighting schemes.

Source files: a1.c

Compliation Code: gcc -o a2 a2.c

Instructions: Compile and launch the executable file. Enter in the number of marking components in the course. Next, enter in the name of the marking components one at a time. Then, enter in the number of different weighting schemes that you will use to compute final grades. Next, enter in the weight of the marking component shown for that particular weighting scheme. Repeat, until all marking components have your specified weight for that particular weighting scheme and repeat for the number of weighting schemes specified. Finally, enter in the students final mark for that particular component. The final grades will then be shown for the different weighting schemes you specified.
